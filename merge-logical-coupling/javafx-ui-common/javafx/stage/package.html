<p>Provides the top-level container classes for JavaFX scripts.</p>
<p>This package encapsulates the JavaFX graphical script surroundings for the
Stage - Scene metaphor, with different capabilites available
to the Stage depending on the underlying semantics of the runtime
container.</p>
<p>The JavaFX <font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Stage interface provides
interfaces and classes for the environment and presentation of JavaFX
script instantiations. The stage presentation specifics for each
JavaFX runtime platform will allow a script to be presented on different
platforms with consistent functionality across each runtime.<br>
</p>
<p>The main areas of functionality of <code>javafx.stage</code>
package include </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><b>Stage:</b> Stages are the graphical container for
JavaFX script instantiations. Stages are the attributed drawing surface
for the JavaFX script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>StageExtension:</b> Each Stage may have one or more StageExtension
    instances set to provide additional functionality for the script.  A StageExtension will
    only be utilized if the script is running within the profile specific to that StageExtension</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>AppletStageExtension:</b> When a JavaFX script is running within a browser, 
    the <code>AppletStageExtension</code> is enabled to manage the drag transition from a browser
    to the desktop.  Dragging a Stage out of a browser is supported in the Java <font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
    plugin versions 6u10 and later.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>StageStyle:</b> The <code>StageStyle</code> specifies the decoration and visibility semantics
    of the <code>Stage</code>.
