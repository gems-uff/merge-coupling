<body>
<p>Provides the set of base classes for the JavaFX Scene Graph API.</p>
<p>This package includes the Scene class, which defines the scene to be
rendered. It also includes
the base Node class, a Group class that contains a
sequence of child nodes for rendering, and a CustomNode class for defining Node
subclasses that create internal nodes as content.</p>
<p>Nodes are connected in a scene graph, which is a tree-like data structure
where each item in the tree has zero or one parent. Each node is either
a "leaf" node with no child nodes or a "branch" with zero or more child
nodes.</p>
