Interfaces and wrapper classes for applying styles to specific types of objects.  All objects to be
styled by a {@link com.sun.css.Stylesheet} must implement the {@link com.sun.css.styleable.Styleable} interface, but 
preexisting classes such as {@link java.awt.Component} are handled via a <code>Styleable</code> 
wrapper rather than burdening them directly with the additional support.
<p>
<code>Styleable</code> wrappers are generally obtained from {@link com.sun.css.types.TypeManager#getStyleable}.
